Google's implementation of document sharing is completely fouled up. The
following is a slighted redacted version of a (formerly) internal email
to colleagues to tell them what I learned about document sharing based
on interactions with their customer support and folks on the net.

--------------

As some of you know, file sharing in Google docs doesn't work the way we
expect. I've exchanged a bunch of emails with Google support about the
issue. The upshot is that *it is working as they expect*, but the way
they expect is counterintuitive (read: a user experience debacle).
Sharing by name is probably the best course for the moment. This rest of
this email summarizes what I learned in a bit more detail.

To share a document, you'll see an option like this:

Most of us and others on the net, expect company-wide sharing
(highlighted above) to cause documents to be visible in our document
list immediately. Some have called this the "visibility problem" on the
Google Apps forums. Even if documents shared with us aren't visible, one
might think that we should be able to find them with the big "Search
Docs" button. Nope -- that doesn't work either.

Both visibility and search (via the Search Docs button) appears to be
limited to documents that you've already accessed... egregiously lame
for any document sharing scheme, especially one from Google. If Google
web search worked this way, it would be completely useless!

*However*, you can find a document if you use the appropriate keywords
and the pull-down menu under Search Docs, like this:

To be clear: this option will find documents that are shared
company-wide, does not require on named document sharing, and works even
if you haven't accessed the document before. The problem, of course, is
that you'll have to guess at keywords for a document whose content you
haven't seen yet. Sigh.
