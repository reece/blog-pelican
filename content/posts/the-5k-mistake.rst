Water heaters are the 433rd most boring topic for blogging, but I need
serious therapy and this blog entry is it. Unless you've already
devoured the 432 more interesting topics, consider skipping to the
bottom for the lessons, which are probably the only good that will come
from this.

\ |image0|\ Ninety minutes ago, I finished one of the least pleasant
conversations I've had in recent memory by asking a plumber to leave our
house and escorting him to the door. Ten minutes before that, I used
profanity, which is rare enough for me in general (alas, becoming more
common these days), but completely unheard of in an argument or with a
stranger. The cause of my anger? $5000 worth of a very professionally
installed ((really, the installation is quite pretty)) water heater that
is significantly noisier than the previous one and inappropriate for our
home and use (per the manufacturer's own product info), and a plumber
((Although I'm sorely tempted, I won't post the name of the plumber.
However, I would be sorry that anyone else had to repeat these
lessons. You may contact me if you're genuinely considering plumbing
work in Glen Park and need a recommendation for someone else.)) who both
dismissed our noise and efficiency concerns and ultimately refused to
work together to resolve the problem. He's walked away. We just blew a
big chunk of change that would be painful under any circumstances, but
on our current financial diet, it is literally sickening.

Previously, we had a 60 gallon tank system with hot water recirculation.
It was completely quiet and gave us instant hot water (which saves a lot
of water), and our gas bills seemed pretty reasonable. San Francisco is
often cold enough that radiating a small bit of heat internally probably
isn't as big a waste as you might imagine. That system was a gem.

When our old tank started leaking, we called a plumber who does work in
our school community. We asked for quotes for tank and tankless
replacement options, both with recirculation, and opted for the latter.
When offset by tax rebates, it would cost us about $1200-$1500 more. We
presumed that the plumber would only spec a system that would work
together. It doesn't work well together on two counts: efficiency and
noise. For the former, the manufacturer's own web site implies as much,
and for the latter, the plumber says that it's our house and not the
system he installed. (Technically he's right, but the new system is
undeniably causing the noise elsewhere.)

And, there's \ `this at
Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_heating#Disadvantages>`__:

    Recirculation systems: Since a tankless water heater is inactive
    when hot water is not being used, they are incompatible with passive
    (convection-based) hot water recirculation systems. They may be
    incompatible with active hot water recirculation systems and will
    certainly use more energy to constantly heat water within the
    piping, defeating one of a tankless water heater's primary
    advantages.

While our old water heater had a pump, the system was specifically
designed to be aided by convection. This would explain why we had hot
water throughout the house, 24h per day and silently, even though the
previous pump's timer was on 5-9am and 7-9pm. I now suspect that the
previous pump was not have really be necessary. I frankly hadn't really
thought about our plumbing until a month ago, and I kinda thought that's
why we hired a professional.

The plumber's response was extremely defensive from the outset. I
suspect he'd not put one of these together before and didn't know some
of the important qualifying questions to ask to determine
appropriateness. Nor did he ask questions like hours of recirculation or
do a (retrospectively) simple noise test. His central argument is that
we selected the system and that he wasn't recommending one.
Really? True, we chose between tank and tankless, but he chose the
heater and pump, he sized them, and his company installed them. That's
right, he'll quote stuff that he doesn't have sufficient experience to
sell. He literally said "You never said that the system needed to be
quiet." I can't argue with that -- we never did. (We also never said
that our check wouldn't bounce and he didn't ask, but it's certainly
reasonable for him to assume that. It didn't.)

His proposed resolutions were feeble. First, he dismissed the noise,
which is roughly as loud as a gentle rain (i.e., not that loud), but
constant and inside our house. Then, he proposed that we (greatly) limit
the recirculation pump times. Yes, that would save some energy, but for
reasons previously cited, it would definitely waste a lot of water and
I'm very skeptical that it would actually save natural gas. He proposed
that we hire a sound specialist to refit and/or insulate the pipes.  The
upshot: no investment from him.

I'm pretty steaming mad -- at the plumber, of course; at myself for not
asking Hanna to get another quote (I was in France at the time), and at
all of us for not doing a modicum of due diligence. The manufacture's
web site and several other sources question the coupling of tankless
water heaters with recirculation. I'm also embarrassed that I resorted
swearing (for which I immediately apologized, and it wasn't *ad
hominem*).

There are more gems in this story, such as the heater required that the
plumber cut two 8" holes in the side of our house -- through stucco --
for air intake and outlet. That's kinda permanent. There's also the fact
that the heater was located right behind my built-in, rotating router
table. The pipes pass within about 2cm of the table and make me a bit
nervous.

Some lessons I learned (again) regarding dealing with house repairs:

-  Never pay in full until you're completely satisfied. You have no
   leverage whatsoever otherwise.
-  Always get a second quote.
-  Do due diligence, and don't assume the professional to have done so.
-  The consequences of decisions made together are more easily shared
   without misgivings.
-  You're never really in as much of a hurry as you might believe. Stop
   and think.

And here are some very specific lessons about water heaters (bear in
mind, I'm not a plumber):

-  Be very careful when coupling hot water recirculation and tankless
   water heaters. The first issue is that tankless are purportedly much
   less efficient, even the ones that throttle the burner.
-  The second is that tankless heaters require much greater water flow
   to trigger ignition. This means that you need a significantly larger
   pump to move much more water in the recirculation line, which in turn
   increases line noise. The difference in water flow noise induced by
   the old and new pumps was substantial in our case.
-  Hybrid water heaters seem to be designed for exactly our need. (Our
   plumber did not offer this and seemed to not know of them when we
   discussed marrying a tank heater to our tankless system.) There are
   several, but the \ `Eternal <﻿http://eternalwaterheater.com/>`__
   brand, which provides recirculation as an option, particularly caught
   my eye.

Please drop some dimes in the cup on your way out.
