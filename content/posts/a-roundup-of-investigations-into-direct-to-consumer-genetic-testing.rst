Earlier this week, the Oversight and Investigation subcommittee of the
Energy and Commerce committee of the US House of Representatives
undertook an investigation of direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing. To some,
this investigation was long overdue; to others, it was a witch hunt by
intrusive regulators. In any case, it's pretty clear that this event
will lead to regulatory oversight that will permanently shape genetic
testing. Below, I've provided a few links with comments and highlights.

First, a brief reminder of some of the recent travails of DTC testing.
In June 2008, the California Department of Public Health sent a "`Notice
to Cease and Desist Performing Genetic Testing Without Licensure or
Physician
Order <http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/files/madrigal.PDF>`__"
to several DTC companies. In the summer and fall of 2009, deCode,
Navigenics, and 23andme contended with financial problems and layoffs
that were widely perceived as a
"`refudiation <http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/07/quote-2.html>`__" of
our readiness to transform genomic data into clinically actionable
information or to make this information personally intriguing. (Yes,
there are examples of both; I mean that DTC does not appeal *broadly*
for either use -- yet.) Then, in October 2009, an "`An agenda for
personalized
medicine <http://http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19812653>`__" made
the shortcomings of DTC testing very public. On May 19, the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on `Oversight and Investigations asked three
prominent DTC companies to provide
information <http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2009:committee-investigates-personal-genetic-testing-kits&catid=122:media-advisories&Itemid=55>`__. On
June 8, 2010, `23andme officially
responded <http://spittoon.23andme.com/2010/06/08/update-from-23andme/>`__
to reports that 96 patient samples had been mixed up by LabCorp, its
CLIA-certified subcontractor. Customers received test results that were
not theirs, presumably leading to at least a few cases of swapped grief
and relief about genetic predispositions. ((Clearly the bulk of the
blame rests with LabCorp, but 23andme apparently had insufficient data
analysis quality control (through, say, variants that would corroborate
gender) to detect this themselves before results were made available to
consumers.)) The `FDA notified five companies on June
10 <http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiagnostics/default.htm>`__,
and `another 14 on July
19 <http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiagnostics/ucm219582.htm>`__,
that effectively declare an intent to regulate genetic testing (see the
excellent analyses by Dan Vorhaus on \ `the first
five <http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2010/06/11/what-five-fda-letters-mean-for-the-future-of-dtc-genetic-testing/>`__
and the `the 14
more <http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2010/07/21/14-more-fda-letters/>`__).

With this background, the House Commerce and Energy Committee meeting
was a set up for a tough day for DTC testing. There are many great
sources of information and commentary. I particularly like
the \ `Genomics Law Report <http://www.genomicslawreport.com/>`__
and \ `Genomes Unzipped <http://www.genomesunzipped.org/>`__
` <http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/>`__\ blogs, which often have
links to source data. Here are some critical links that cover the
pro-regulation and laissez-faire viewpoints:

The GAO, with their `2010 report on deceptive marketing
practices <http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-847T>`__ and the audio
recordings of  telephone counseling, provided damaging testimony that
will make nearly everyone's jaw drop. Think traveling salesmen with hair
tonics 100 years later. If you think these were the just the small
players, think again: A counselor at Navigenics was caught on tape
saying "you’d be in the high risk of, you know, pretty much
getting [breast cancer]". Don't miss the explosive audio transcripts (3
minutes) of DTC telephone counselors with undercover customers to see
exactly how bad this can get. Also see the
