How is it that someone like me, *i.e.* with substantial geek tendencies,
goes this long without blogging? At one time, I surely thought that the
young whippersnappers were wasting their time with this blogging thing.
I mean, get real, who's gonna read this crap? It turns out lots of
people do.

The real surprise to me, though, was not that people write and read
blogs. The surprise is the community that blogging builds around ideas
and projects. I completely missed that, and it's \*the\* thing.

So, I have a confession: I really do want to blog. I've wanted to for a
while from the depths of my virtual data closet. I have a deep yearning
to say something important, profound, consequential, insightful. But
what?

|image0|\ At cathartic times like this, I turn to two people. First,
there's `Curly <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_Howard>`__, my
erstwhile Wonder Bread Zen master and hero, who exclaimed "I keep trying
to think but nothing happens." Exactly -- too much thinking.

Then there's Dr. Jack Pribnow, my high-school honors calculus teacher.
He was the one who told me to not think too hard about a calculus proof
before diving in. I was actually quite good at calculus proofs, but
every once in a while one would stump me. Dr. Pribnow insightfully told
me that my problem was that I wanted to see the whole thing done before
I started. He was right: I hated "mistakes" so much that I didn't start
down the path.

So, this first post is for Curly and Jack (er, respectfully, Dr.
Pribnow) and for their lessons that I repeat to myself often. Here's to
leaping before I look and not thinking too hard about it.
