|Stanley Hall|

As many of you know by now, I left `Genentech <http://gene.com>`__ in
September to join UC Berkeley as the `Chief Scientist of the Genome
Commons <http://genomecommons.org/2009/10/01/reece-hart-joins-as-chief-scientist/>`__.
I'm part of `QB3 <http://qb3.org>`__, the California Institute for
Quantitative Biology (no I don't understand the abbreviation either).

I'm collaborating with Steven Brenner, Jasper Rine, and Lior Pachter at
Berkeley, and Robert Nussbaum and Bernie Lo at UCSF, to address the
technical, scientific, clinical, and ethical opportunities associated
with interpreting genomic data. It's an excitingÂ time and an exciting
place.

To be sure, I'll be posting a lot more about that here.
