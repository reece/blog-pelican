I don't know Merlin Mann. He doesn't know me. I watch him on the
computer. That is the extent of our relationship. So, you ask, howÂ did
that occasionally crazy, often manic, and always long-winded
motivational speaker make me do it?First, you gotta know that I call
Merlin a motivational speaker as though the term had never been used
before. He is \*the\* motivational speaker.

Second, I was primed. There I was pushing a PO from one side of my desk
to the other, again, and wondering how I got here. To paraphrase the
Talking Heads, this should not be part of my otherwise beautiful life.
