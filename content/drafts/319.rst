Section 3.3.9 of the new agreement says that ad networks will only be
allowed to share that data if:

    The collection, use or disclosure is for the purpose of serving
    advertising to Your Application; is provided to an independent
    advertising service provider whose primary business is serving
    mobile ads (for example, an advertising service provider owned by or
    affiliated with a developer or distributor of mobile devices, mobile
    operating systems or development environments other than Apple would
    not qualify as independent); and the disclosure is limited to UDID,
    user location data, and other data specifically designated by Apple
    as available for advertising purposes.
