| I recently got this on my `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`__ 9.10
  (Karmic) laptop:
| [code='bash']
| # apt-get update
| ...
| W: `GPG <http://www.gnupg.org/>`__ error:
  http://download.virtualbox.org karmic Release: The following
  signatures were invalid: BADSIG DCF9F87B6DFBCBAE Sun Microsystems,
  Inc. (xVM `VirtualBox <http://www.virtualbox.org/>`__ archive signing
  key)

Drat. My first suspicion was that the chronic laptop crashing under
karmic koala caused the keyrings to become corrupted (I've had repeated
file corruption elsewhere). So, I removed and rebuilt the keyrings:

| [code='bash']
| root@snafu:/etc/apt# mkdir rings
| root@snafu:/etc/apt# mv secring.gpg trust\* rings/
| root@snafu:/etc/apt# grep key: sources.list.d/\*.list \| cut -d: -f3-
  \| sh -x
| [/code]

| Dang. Same problem. Then I stumbled upon a suggestion in the comments
  in a blog to do this:
| [code='bash']
| root@snafu:/etc/apt# #sudo rm -f /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/\*
| [/code]

That worked, and I hate that it did... more bad juju for my current
laptop+ubuntu setup.
