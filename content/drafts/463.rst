Sidenote: ``#!`` is called a shebang and is evaluated when the shell
(technically, execve in the kernel) attempts to execute the named
script. This implies that the script has execute permissions.

The rest of the shebang line is the program and optional arguments
that are used to execute the text file. You'll typically see
``/usr/bin/python`` there for Python scripts. However, it's often
useful to use the first python in your PATH rather than a hardwired
path. ``/usr/bin/env`` executes the named argument by searching your
PATH.

| So, putting this all together in the case above, an attempt to
  execute
| the actual execution is equivalent to typing
  ``/usr/bin/env python openpyxl-version``.
